                A military-type mobile computer housed in a reinforced case
                A portable computer with three LCD screens

                The MIT Suitcase Computer, MIT Digital Systems Laboratory, 1975
                A portable computer is a computer designed to be easily moved from one place to another, as opposed
                to
                those
                designed
                to remain stationary at a single location such as desktops and workstations. These computers usually
                include
                a
                display
                and keyboard that are directly connected to the main case, all sharing a single power plug together,
                much
                like
                later
                desktop computers called all-in-ones (AIO) that integrate the system's internal components into the same
                case as
                the
                display. In modern usage, a portable computer usually refers to a very light and compact personal
                computer
                such as a
                laptop, miniature or pocket-sized computer, while touchscreen-based handheld ("palmtop") devices such as
                tablet,
                phablet
                and smartphone are called mobile devices instead.

                The first commercially sold portable computer might be the 20-pound (9.1 kg) MCM/70, released 1974. The
                next
                major
                portables were the 50-pound (23 kg) IBM 5100 (1975), Osborne's 24-pound (11 kg) CP/M-based Osborne 1
                (1981)
                and
                Compaq's
                28-pound (13 kg), advertised as 100% IBM PC compatible Compaq Portable (1983). These luggable computers
                still
                required a
                continuous connection to an external power source; this limitation was later overcome by the laptop
                computers.
                Laptops were followed by lighter models such as netbooks, so that in the 2000s mobile devices and by
                2007
                smartphones
                made the term "portable" rather meaningless. The 2010s introduced wearable computers such as
                smartwatches.

                Portable computers, by their nature, are generally microcomputers. Larger portable computers were
                commonly
                known as
                'Lunchbox' or 'Luggable' computers. They are also called 'Portable Workstations' or 'Portable PCs'. In
                Japan
                they were
                often called 'Bentocom'. (ベントコン, Bentokon) from "bento"

                Portable computers, more narrowly defined, are distinct from desktop replacement computers in that they
                usually
                were
                constructed from full-specification desktop components, and often do not incorporate features associated
                with
                laptops or
                mobile devices. A portable computer in this usage, versus a laptop or other mobile computing device,
                have a
                standard
                motherboard or backplane providing plug-in slots for add-in cards. This allows mission specific cards
                such
                as
                test, A/D,
                or communication protocol (IEEE-488, 1553) to be installed. Portable computers also provide for more
                disk
                storage by
                using standard disk drives and provide for multiple drives.

            <p>
                In 1973, the IBM Los Gatos Scientific Center developed a portable computer prototype called SCAMP
                (Special
                Computer APL
                Machine Portable) based on the IBM PALM processor with a Philips compact cassette drive, small CRT and
                full
                function
                keyboard. SCAMP emulated an IBM 1130 minicomputer in order to run APL\1130. In 1973, APL was
                generally
                available only
                on mainframe computers, and most desktop sized microcomputers such as the Wang 2200 or HP 9800 offered
                only
                BASIC.
                Because SCAMP was the first to emulate APL\1130 performance on a portable, single user computer, PC
                Magazine
                in
                1983
                designated SCAMP a "revolutionary concept" and "the world's first personal computer". The
                engineering
                prototype is
                in the Smithsonian Institution.

                Xerox NoteTaker, developed in 1976 at Xerox PARC, was a precursor to later portable computers from
                Osborne
                Computer
                Corporation and Compaq, though it remained a prototype and did not enter production.

            <h3 id="IBM5100">IBM 5100</h3>
            <p>
                Successful demonstrations of the 1973 SCAMP prototype led to the first commercial IBM 5100 portable
                microcomputer
                launched in 1975. The product incorporated an IBM PALM processor, 5-inch (130 mm) CRT, full function
                keyboard
                and the
                ability to be programmed in both APL and BASIC for engineers, analysts, statisticians and other business
                problem-solvers. (IBM provided different models of the 5100 supporting only BASIC, only APL, or both
                selectable
                by a
                physical switch on the front panel.) IBM referred to its PALM processor as a microprocessor, though
                they
                used
                that term to mean a processor that executes microcode to implement a higher-level instruction set,
                rather
                than
                its
                conventional definition of a complete processor on a single silicon integrated circuit; the PALM
                processor
                was a
                large
                circuit board populated with over a dozen chips. In the late 1960s, such a machine would have been
                nearly as
                large as
                two desks and would have weighed about half a ton (0.45 t). In comparison, the IBM 5100 weighed about 53
                pounds
                (24 kg
                and very portable for that time).

            <p>
                The MIT Suitcase Computer, constructed in 1975, was the first known microprocessor-based portable
                computer.
                It
                was based
                on the Motorola 6800. Constructed in a Samsonite suitcase approximately 20 by 30 by 8 inches (510 mm ×
                760
                mm ×
                200 mm)
                and weighing approximately 20 lb (9.1 kg), it had 4K of SRAM, a serial port to accept downloaded
                software
                and
                connect to
                a modem, a keyboard and a 40-column thermal printer taken from a cash register. Built by student David
                Emberson
                in the
                MIT Digital Systems Laboratory as a thesis project, it never entered production. It is currently in the
                collection of
                Dr. Hoo-Min D. Toong.

            <h3 id="Micro-Star-or-Small-One">Micro Star or Small One</h3>
            <p>
                An early portable computer was manufactured in 1979 by GM Research, a small company in Santa Monica,
                California. The
                machine which was designed and patented by James Murez. It was called the Micro Star and later the name
                was
                changed to
                The Small One. Although Xerox claims to have designed the first such system, the machine by Murez
                predated
                anything on
                the market or that had been documented in any publication at the time – hence the patent was issued. As
                early as
                1979,
                the U.S. Government was contracting to purchase these machines. Other major customers included Sandia
                Labs,
                General
                Dynamics, BBN (featured on the cover of their annual report in 1980 as the C.A.T. system) and several
                dozen
                private
                individuals and companies around the world. In 1979, Adam Osborne viewed the machine along with several
                hundred
                other
                visitors at the first computer show that was sponsored by the IEEE Westec in Los Angeles. Later that
                year
                the
                machine
                was also shown at the first COMDEX show.

                The portable micro computer; the "Portal" of the French company R2E Micral CCMC officially appeared in
                September
                1980 at
                the Sicob show in Paris. The Portal was a portable microcomputer designed and marketed by the studies
                and
                developments
                department of the French firm R2E Micral in 1980 at the request of the company CCMC specializing in
                payroll
                and
                accounting. The Portal was based on an intel 8085 processor, 8-bit, clocked at 2 MHz. It was equipped
                with a
                central 64
                KB RAM, a keyboard with 58 alpha numeric keys and 11 numeric keys (separate blocks), a 32-character

                channel,
                a
                synchronous channel, a 220 V power supply. Designed for an operating temperature of 15–35 °C (59–95 °F),
                it
                weighed 12
                kilograms (26 lb) and its dimensions were 45 cm × 45 cm × 15 cm (17.7 in × 17.7 in × 5.9 in). It
                provided
                total
                mobility. Its operating system was Prolog. A few hundred were sold between 1980 and 1983.

                which owed much to the NoteTaker's design. The company had early success with the design and went public
                but
                later due
                to small screen sizes and other devices being released found trouble selling the Osborne. The Osborne 1
                is
                about the
                size and weight of a sewing machine, and was advertised as the only computer that would fit underneath
                an
                airline
                seat.

                Another early portable computer released in 1982 was named the Kaypro II, although it was the company's
                first
                commercially available product. Some of the press mocked its design—one magazine described Kaypro
                Corporation as
                "producing computers packaged in tin cans". Others raved about its value, as the company advertised
                the
                Kaypro II as
                "the $1,595 computer that sells for $1,595", some noting that the included software bundle had a
                retail
                value over
                $1,000 by itself, and by mid-1983 the company was selling more than 10,000 units a month, briefly making
                it
                the
                fifth-largest computer maker in the world. It managed to correct most of the Osborne 1's deficiencies:
                the
                screen was
                larger and showed more characters at once, the floppy drives stored over twice as much data, the case
                was
                more
                attractive-looking, and it was also much better-built and more reliable.

                The Grid Compass ran its own operating system, GRiD-OS. Its specialized software and high price
                (US$8,000–10,000) meant
                that it was limited to specialized applications. The main buyer was the U.S. government. NASA used it on
                the
                Space
                Shuttle during the early 1980s, as it was powerful, lightweight, and compact. The military Special
                Forces
                also
                purchased
                the machine, as it could be used by paratroopers in combat.

                Although Columbia Data Product's MPC 1600, "Multi Personal Computer" came out in June 1983, one of
                the
                first
                extensively IBM PC compatible computers was the Compaq Portable. Eagle Computer then came out with their
                offering.
                and Corona Data Systems's PPC-400., the "portable" Hyperion Computer System. Both Eagle Computer and
                Columbia
                were sued by IBM for copyright infringement of its BIOS. They settled and were forced to halt
                production.
                Neither the
                Columbia nor the Eagle were nearly as IBM PC DOS compatible as Compaq's offerings.
